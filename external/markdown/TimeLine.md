| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1805           | Thomas Grimshaw was living in and owner of Crowtrees. The Grimshaws were maltsters and cloth manufacturers, putting out worsted then cotton warps and weft yarn to hundreds of domestic handloom weavers for weaving into c.50yd pieces of cloth. |
| 1807           | A new facade was added to Crowtrees using Utherstone Quarry stone. 1807 dated Crowtrees spout. 1807 is also the date of Higherford Bridge for the new turnpike road. |
| 1823           | New face added to Beanfield House by and for the Grimshaws.  |
| 1824           | Thomas Grimshaw, cotton manufacturer, mortgages Crowtrees to fund the building of Higherford Mill for throstle spinning on the orchard in between The Fold and the Foreside handloom cottages. Through half a mile of his ancient farmland he built a waterpower system with weir, dam for a one acre mill lodge, sluices and an exceptional double system of head race goits or leats, tunnels and overflows to maximise wheel power. **This was the last local water powered cotton mill and had a state of the art low volume, medium head duplex water supply system.** |
| 1824           | Higherford water-spinning mill was financed by Thomas Grimshaw of Crowtrees and operated by his sons with William Bracewell, all pre-industrial handloom cloth manufacturers. The Spinning Mill, erected by contractor John Lane, was completed in 1824 and the original date stone (rebuilt into the later South shed wall) remains, as well as a masonry specification for a factory of 4 main storeys (a total of 6 if including cellar and roof attic) with wheelhouse to the north and a 2 storey section at the southern end possibly for dandy hand looms such as those made at that time by local loom maker, John Pilling, established in Trawden in 1819. (Dandy looms are fly shuttle hand looms with automatic cloth take up gears at the front and continuous, weighted warp let off motion to maintain tension to the rear.) The waterpower works, mill lodge, weir sluice, water leats and mill sluices, wheelhouse, cellar, tailrace tunnel and most of the North facing 4 storey wall remain. The cills of the 4th floor windows and some of the 1824 cast iron drive shaft wall boxes are clearly visible in the North wall.<br/>To maximise available power from the 26ft dia. by 9ft wide high back shot timber wheel, the mill has unusual (possibly now unique) dual leats feeding a double decker pentrough through double decked control sluices. The river leat runs past the one acre mill lodge, filling it via an overflow side weir when the river is high and continuing to the top storey of the pentrough at river level and through the highest draught lid slot onto the wheel. A sluice between the river leat and North East corner of the Mill lodge, for scouring silt was also used to refill the lodge overnight at times of low water. (This sluice was replaced with a concrete and stone repair after the mill closed and the overflow filling weir has been lowered to become an unobstructed inlet.) A second low-level leat, about 3ft deeper, runs in parallel from the mill lodge via the bottom pentrough deck to the lower draught lid slots to keep the mill running when the river level was down, or to boost power when needed.<br/>Thomas Grimshaw founded the mill, which was then managed by his sons James and Christopher Grimshaw with Wm Bracewell to spin cotton yarn on throstle frames. (Throstles are updated metal framed higher speed versions of the earlier timber framed Arkwright water frames.) Shuttle weft bobbins and beamed warps were put out to domestic handloom weavers and Dandy Shops for weaving. The finished cloth pieces were collected, some of which were sent to Thompson & Co in Clitheroe and to Henry Fielding & Bros at Catterall for printing. |
| 1832           | Higherford water-spinning mill was financed by Thomas Grimshaw of Crowtrees and operated by his sons with William Bracewell, all pre-industrial handloom cloth manufacturers. The Spinning Mill, erected by contractor John Lane, was completed in 1824 and the original date stone (rebuilt into the later South shed wall) remains, as well as a masonry specification for a factory of 4 main storeys (a total of 6 if including cellar and roof attic) with wheelhouse to the north and a 2 storey section at the southern end possibly for dandy hand looms such as those made at that time by local loom maker, John Pilling, established in Trawden in 1819. (Dandy looms are fly shuttle hand looms with automatic cloth take up gears at the front and continuous, weighted warp let off motion to maintain tension to the rear.)

| 1834           | Grimshaw & Bracewell are recorded as cotton traders.  Bank House is built by and for the Grimshaws. |
| 1836           | The Parliamentary power loom returns show Higherford Mill weaving on 74 power looms. Spinning their own cotton, the firm also employed 400 domestic handloom weavers.<br/>Evidence via M Rothwell – the Parliamentary power loom returns refer to the first three power loom factories in the locality being Higherford (Grimshaw’s 74 looms), Hodge Bank (Bolton’s 136 looms), and Brierfield (Tunstill’s 106 looms). Nothing remains of Hodge Bank Mill, buried under road embankments at Reedyford and the original Brierfield Mill was obliterated by the two 1868 spinning mills and 5 weaving sheds built over it. **Higherford Mill is therefore one of the very earliest surviving power loom Mills in the area.** <br/>John Pilling and Son were the earliest local power loom makers (established 1819) and their surviving ledgers dating from Dec.1850 show an ongoing account for loom accessories and new looms with C Grimshaw, making it almost certain that weaving started in 1832 on wooden framed Pilling wiper (cam operated) power looms made in Trawden. |
| 1838           | Grace Grimshaw’s will subdivides the Grimshaw estate. Nicholas Grimshaw inherits Crowtrees. |
| 1849/51        | The ‘Old’ North Weaving Shed is completed. The tithe map revised up to 1848, shows the original mill, wheelhouse and beam engine house without the weaving shed, so the earliest date for this early north light weaving shed to be at work would be 1849. The old north shed columns are to a particularly lightweight early design, quite unlike most mills commissioned after 1850. They have a fragile line-shaft support bracket, which was already obsolete in Manchester by this time, according to Fitzgerald (1988), indicating a building date close to 1850. A line-by-line analysis of the surviving John Pilling and Sons 1851 Waste Book ledger, held in the Lancashire Archives, shows that C Grimshaw paid for an order of 39 new iron looms during October and November 1851, deliveries commencing on 6th October 1851. The Old Shed must therefore have been completed by September 1851 at the latest to receive these 39 iron power looms made in Colne. <br/>In addition to the 74 timber framed Trawden looms from the spinning mill, this totals at least 113 looms for which evidence is available (there may also have been a delivery of looms in 1850 for which we do not yet have evidence). The Old Shed was driven by two drive shafts. The one from the steam engine required modification of the cast iron pentrough bottom to reach the weaving shed wall box - which is still in place. The other shaft from the waterwheel remains, complete with dog clutch and drive gear still in place to combine (or disengage) the power of the waterwheel with that of the steam engine.<br/>The old shed was built to be as large as possible, demolishing a smithy to the North, dug into the hillside on the West, a narrow access past the waterwheel to the South, limited by Foreside and the river to the East and ‘L’ shaped because the Grimshaws did not own three handloom cottages that still occupy the North-Eastern quadrant. The intent is clear from the columns built into the walls to extend and complete the square, but the cottages remain to this day hemmed in by the mill walls. Grimshaws had built a replacement water-powered smithy and mechanic’s shop opposite the spinning mill driven by a narrow approximately 6ft diameter waterwheel in a slot under the floor with wheel rims still visible in 2005, but which has since been walled in. This wheel, above and at right angles to the river, could only have been fed with water from the mill pentrough via a culvert under the road and used to maintain mill machinery.<br/>	The 1849/51 weaving shed was built for over 214 looms. Fortunately, at first, with no existing yarn preparation and cloth inspection warehouse, one quarter of the area could be used for beaming warps, winding weft, cloth inspection and despatch, leaving space to run up to 160 looms. <br/>	Northlight weaving sheds with their saw-tooth roofs were introduced in Manchester and Todmorden in about 1834, but did not become the norm until after 1850. No metal-framed north-light shed earlier than Higherford Mill’s Old Shed is known to survive. A timber-framed north light shed at Abbey Mill near Chorley originally erected in 1847 is thought to have been ‘rebuilt at least twice’ and ‘may contain some original components’ (Roger Holden, ”Manufacturing the Cloth of the World”). The old shed at **Higherford built 1849/51is therefore one of the oldest survivors and could now possibly be the earliest original north-light weaving shed structure still standing in the world.** |
| 1856           | James Grimshaw inherits Crowtrees from his elder brother, Nicholas. |
| c.1856         | To bring the weaving shed up to full capacity, the 3 storey warehouse building was built to receive warp sizing, beaming, drawing in, weft rewinding, cloth inspection and delivery departments from the north-light shed. The masonry shows this was built on top of the south parapet stones of the 1849/51 weaving shed and spanning across to the north wall of the 1824 four storey mill, (which is today the south wall of the present three storey mill). The front elevation windows of this building are of similar design to those in the stations of the East Lancashire Railway (opened in 1849). With little other dating evidence, this infers a date within the 1850s possibly funded by the 1856 inheritance. The top floor loading door has had a low wall inserted that Christopher Grimshaw had instructed to be built after he nearly fell to his death, according to the last textile owner, Mr Robert Wiseman in 1970.<br/>The mill is at this time an efficient full ‘Vertical’ textile operation, i.e. taking in the raw cotton bales and carrying out every process from fibre to fabric. Starting in the 1824 mill:**Ground Floor:** Cotton bales taken in, stored then broken and blended in the devils and scutched into laps (rolls of cotton wool) - high fire risk.**First Floor:** Carding into slivers (soft, weak parallel cotton fibre ‘ropes’ coiled into fibre ‘cans’**Second Floor:** Draw frames combine slivers for roving frames to produce soft parallel ‘strings’ on bobbins ready for spinning**Third Floor:** Spinning on throstles that draw out and twist the fibres into competent yarns. Also doubling frames to produce folded (plied) yarns.The yarn was passed through communicating doors to the second floor of the central mid 1850s warehouse block for winding onto weft pirns for the shuttles and onto creel bobbins for warp beaming before sizing, loom beaming and looming, i.e. drawing-in warps into the heald shafts and reeds. The two doors are now windows with the bottom halves of the door openings visibly walled up, one more obvious than the other.The drawn in warp beams and wound weft pirns were sent down the hoist to be gaited-up and woven in the 1849/51 north-light weaving shed before 100yd cloth pieces are cut off before cloth inspection in the warehouse for measuring, plaiting into bolts and delivery to the customer.br> |
| 1858           | The partnership becomes Christopher Grimshaw and Nephew, Thomas Grimshaw. |
| 1863           | The growing cotton famine financial crisis, caused by the American Civil War (1861-1865) disrupting imports, hits Higherford Mill. |
| 1865           | Christopher Grimshaw dies and a new partnership established between Thomas Grimshaw and Richard W Harper his brother-in-law. |
| 1867           | Estimated to be spinning on 10,000 throstle spindles and weaving on 200 looms, the mill is put up for sale. |
| 1868           | Richard Harper bought the Mill, employing 62 people for cotton spinning with Thomas Grimshaw weaving in the 1849/51 shed on 200 looms. Grimshaw had ordered 58 new looms in January with hundreds of loom parts from John Pilling & Sons. |
| 1869           | 60 new John Pilling looms were sold off by Grimshaw to give up business in 1870. The weaving areas were leased to manufacturers on a Room and Power basis including Joseph Sunderland later of Oak Bank Mill Nelson and Fergus Wilkinson later of Pendle Street Mill Nelson. |
| 1873           | Ownership was transferred in settlement of a debt by John and Joseph Craven of Dalton Mills Keighley, (worsted spinners and manufacturers who had bought John Pilling worsted looms for Dalton Mills in 1851). |
| 1875           | J and J Craven ran the Spinning Mill, with weaving still leased to Room and Power manufacturers. |
| c. 1875 - 1880 | Various weaving manufacturers rented the Weaving Shed 1871-1880 including Joseph Sunderland, Fergus Wilkinson and for a few years after c.1875 Thomas Grimshaw in partnership with William Holt probably on a Room and Power basis. |
| 1879           | John Craven died, and until 1906, Higherford Mill was owned by his executors. |
| 1880           | Thomas Thornber Smith and Thomas Wiseman, spinners and beamers of Vivary Bridge Mill Colne, leased the whole mill. An adjoining lease plan to the south shows the south end of the spinning mill still in place at this time. Thomas Wiseman who lived at Bank House, had been bookkeeper for Grimshaw and Bracewell. Wiseman later became sole proprietor of the Higherford business, but retained the name Smith and Wiseman. |
| 1882           | Thomas Wiseman died at Bank House and his son Robert Holt   Wiseman took over. The spinning operation was closed down and the 4 storey mill dismantled, the stone being reused to build a second north light South Shed for 100% weaving. The two communicating doorways between spinning mill and top floor warehouse were converted to windows at second floor level and are still visible.<br/>This more than doubled the number of looms to 458. According to RH Wiseman’s son, R Wiseman in 1969, a replacement 26ft dia. by 9ft wide metal waterwheel was installed – probably with ventilated buckets to increase power by up to 24%. Were this and an 1832 beam engine enough to deliver over 220hp to fully power both the old and new weaving sheds? It is possible a higher pressure boiler had previously been fitted and the beam engine compounded by adding a second, high pressure cylinder to double its power |
| 1885           | The Mill had 459 looms with no spinning – information from directory data probably collected in 1884. |
| 1888           | For increased power, new boiler and engine rooms were built side by side at the rear of the mill with an overall first floor cloth warehouse, inspection and despatch room with loading door. This location allowed the existing plant to drive the mill while the new engine and boiler were being erected. |
| 1889           | The new 200hp Daniel Adamson tandem compound engine with cylinders of 16”HP and 28”LP by 3ft 6in stroke running at 72rpm and 7ft6in diameter by 30ft long 100psi Daniel Adamson boiler were installed in the new two storey west range, which incorporated the 1832 engine house west wall. By building the new power plant outside the existing footprint interruption to production caused by the changeover could be minimised when the new engine was set to work in Feb 1889. The old beam engine was then removed and its floor area converted to extra production space in south shed. An infill was built to link the 3 storey block to the new 2 storey range utilising the north wall of the 1832 engine house. |
| 1899 - 1906    | Book of receipts with the following suppliers:<br/>Engineering: Daniel Adamson, Dukinfield; William Roberts, Nelson, Howard and Bullough, Accrington	Engine driving ropes and loom twine: Gott, Nelson.Looms: John Pilling & Sons, Colne; Pemberton & Co, Burnley, Harling & Todd, Burnley, George Keighley, Burnley, Shuttles: Kirk, BurnleyYarn: Spinning mill companies: Palm; Duchess; King; Borough, Moorfield, Hallershaw, Star, Ridgefield, Pine, Smallbrook, Chadderton, Dewhurst, Greenacres, Crawford and Standard Mills. |
| 1906           | RH Wiseman bought the Mill from the Executors of J Craven. The top floor of the mill still has warp sizing and beaming plant shown on the sale plan where it had been placed to receive yarn from the third floor of the now dismantled spinning mill. There was a total of 484 looms in the two weaving sheds. The steel and iron waterwheel, Bennis boiler stokers and a Green’s economiser are also described as providing inexpensive power. The particulars also show that the mill owned the blacksmith’s water powered mechanics workshop across the road, essential for millwrighting repairs in the early days before the local engineering industry had become fully established. Here there is a slot for a small waterwheel once visible from the river but now hidden by infill, which could only have been fed from the mill’s own pentrough supply in a pipe or culvert under the road, probably to drive a forge bellows, hammer, drill and possibly a lathe. |
| 1921           | (Robert Wiseman date) The waterwheel was removed, the draught lid slots sealed up with concrete and a swept 20ft tapered iron chute fitted to drive a crossflow cylindrical turbine. This was installed on a concrete slab about 10ft below the former wheel centre for mechanical drive by rope up to the existing shafting with control by large hand wheel and speed indicator. This proved to be more difficult to keep at constant speed with the steam engine than the 26ftx9ft waterwheel with its massive flywheel effect. |
| 1923           | RH Wiseman died                                              |
| 1926           | (Robert Wiseman date) The turbine output was connected to a generator to deliver hydro-electric lighting and ancillary power. The disused mechanical drive rope wheel was still in place high above the turbine when the mill closed in 1971. |
| 1934           | The Mill closed due to trading failure in the depression.    |
| 1936           | Higherford Mill was closed for 2 years during the depression, during which the steam engine was dismantled and possibly sold to raise funds. TM and R Wiseman register as T and R Wiseman Limited to restart. Two Sentinel Diesel 50kva generators were installed to replace the steam engine. The South Shed line shafts are driven by several group drive 40hp electric motors, while the North Shed looms are fitted with individual motors, probably to prevent vibration of the lightweight early roof structure. The electric lift conversion of the hoist by Foulds of Colne and a connection to mains electricity may also have been carried out at this time. |
| 1950s          | Two McLaren 69kva 3ph generators replace the earlier sets but one pre war Sentinel unit is retained on standby. Mains cable and change over switchgear are installed but rarely used and a coal fired packaged heating boiler installed to replace the Lancashire boiler. |
| 1956           | Wiseman’s cease production but keep looms on site which are to be scrapped under 1959/60 Cotton Industry Act. |
| 1957           | Some space is leased to the Higherford Weaving Company for 150 looms. |
| 1960           | Hartley Bros (1926) Limited take over weaving and two Merchant converters Rae, Shaw and Co and R J Litton and Co also use the mill. It is said by a former tackler, Mr Dickson, that Hartley Bros (1926) Limited installed looms from their Oak Mill at Colne that they had allegedly been paid to scrap. They continue to buy loom parts and accessories from John Pilling and Sons Ltd. |
| 1962           | Flood damage to the weir on the river reduces the volume of water and ends the effectiveness of water power although water continues to run through the mill races to the mill lodge and mill. |
| 1971           | Hartley Bros (1926) Limited weave out by the summer of 1971. 300 looms of various types were in use, acquired as other mills closed including: plain, circular box, cross rod, under-twill and dobby machines produced by several makers:John Pilling & Sons, Colne; George Hattersley, KeighleyWilliam Bell White, Colne; Butterworth & Dickinson, BurnleyCooper Bros, BurnleyPemberton, Burnley <br/>Some John Pilling circular box looms and parts and a WB White card lacing machine were bought at the auction sale by E Hartley & Co of North Valley Shed Colne who continued to use them there to weave check shirtings for another quarter of a century - until Clive Hartley wove out in 1996. Four of these looms and the card lacing machine have been preserved, one of these looms is currently back in the Old Shed where these circular box looms wove coloured checks and tartans. |
| 1971           | When the Mill ceased production, its assets, the waterpower works and associated land were divided up and sold off. The new owner of the mill converted parts of it to commercial workspace units. A yard was formed along Gisburn Road by dismantling the front wall of the 1882 South weaving shed and reusing the masonry to build an accessible frontage set back from the main road. The Old Shed was also subdivided and units let as workshops or for storage. Due to lack of maintenance the rest became derelict. Uses included engineering, automotive electronics fitting and valeting, garden furniture and fireplace manufacture, pump servicing, cushion making and cloth warehousing. |
| 1994           | In December 1994 an application was submitted for consent to demolish the Mill, on the grounds that it was unsafe and full of dry rot, and for planning permission to build 24 houses on the site. Villagers, The Heritage Trust for the North West and their supporters objected to several damaging schemes. |
| 1996           | The mill was spotlisted Grade II, after the responsible Government Ministry was requested to take urgent action, supported by submitting university architectural industrial history research projects undertaken on the mill in 1969 and the early 70s that identified its importance. Complete earlier mills evidencing the use of water power in conjunction with early steam power for weaving are rare, and this was a key reason why the building was spot listed in 1996. |
| 1999           | The Heritage Trust for the North West, after its successful five year campaign to save the Mill purchased Higherford Mill with a loan from the Architectural Heritage Fund. Lancashire County Council’s Property Consultancy was appointed to provide the Architectural and Engineering support to repair and conserve this important pioneering textile mill. |
| 2000           | As a registered Building Preservation Trust, the Trust aims to find appropriate and sustainable new uses for old buildings. Its vision was for the Mill to become a focal point for the Creative Industries in East Lancashire. Accordingly a programme was initiated for survey, structural analysis and design for grant funded repair, conservation and conversion to meet these new objectives. Heavy structural repairs were undertaken to rotten trusses and floors floor and 10 new units created while keeping the South shed units in operation. A fully equipped joinery workshop was set up in the old weaving shed for the Trust subsidiary, Conservation Services NW to make all the specialised joinery required, including replacement North-light glazing units to exactly match an original early 19th century panel found on site. |
| 2004           | The Higherford Mill project proposals and progress were shown to HRH Prince Charles when he visited the Trust’s Pendle Heritage Centre. |
| 2006           | The Mill was featured in the BBC Restoration TV series after completion of Phase I and reached the final for the NW region. |
| 2009           | By completion of Phase II, Offices, 36 creative industries workshops and studios had been constructed and let, providing much needed facilities for artists, artisans as well as opportunities for local employment. Rents from the studios pay for the upkeep of the Mill. Three studies were carried out by consultants, supported by the Forest of Bowland AONB and Lancaster University which proved the technical feasibility for reinstating the waterwheel in a hydro power scheme. |
| 2010           | Although Phase III of the project had been designed to minimise carbon footprint, austerity measures imposed following the global financial crisis limited progress. Conversion of the unfinished areas at the rear of the mill was planned for visitor facilities, an art gallery / multi-use space, educational resource centre and when funds permit a new reception at the front of the Mill. An ultimate objective is to restore the waterwheel, weir and historic mill races for a hydropower scheme to make the mill carbon negative. |
